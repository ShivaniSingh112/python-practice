In other words, a recursive function breaks down a problem into smaller subproblems and calls itself to solve those subproblems until a base case is reached, at which point the recursion stops. Recursion is often used for problems that can be naturally divided into smaller, similar subproblems. Key characteristics of recursion include:\n","\n","Base Case: Every recursive function should have one or more base cases that define when the recursion should stop. When the base case is reached, the function returns a value or performs a specific action without making any further recursive calls.\n","\n","Divide and Conquer: Recursive functions divide a problem into smaller, more manageable subproblems. Each recursive call works on a smaller version of the problem, and the results are combined to solve the larger problem.\n","\n","Function Call Stack: In languages like Python, each recursive call is added to the call stack. The call stack keeps track of all the function calls and their local variables.

The purpose of docstrings is to provide human-readable documentation for code, making it easier for developers to understand how to use the code and what it does. Docstrings are especially useful when writing functions and methods because they serve as a form of inline documentation.\n","\n","Docstrings are typically placed within triple quotes (single or double) immediately following the definition of a module, class, function, or method. There are two primary styles for docstrings in Python: one-line and multi-line docstrings.\n","\n","One-Line Docstrings:\n","\n","One-line docstrings are used to provide a brief, one-line description of a function or method.\n","They are enclosed in triple quotes on a single line.\n","Multi-Line Docstrings:\n","\n","Multi-line docstrings are used when you need to provide more detailed documentation for a function or method. They can span multiple lines and include additional information, such as parameter descriptions, usage examples, and other details.\n","Multi-line docstrings are enclosed in triple quotes and are typically formatted with a summary line followed by an empty line and then additional details."],"metadata":{"id":"KnMXh_zzcQHT"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["def add(x, y):\n","    \"\"\"Return the sum of two numbers.\"\"\"\n","    return x + y"],"metadata":{"id":"0QhxxiM7casT"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Naming functions and variables in Python is crucial for writing clean, readable, and maintainable code. Following best practices and adhering to naming conventions can make your code more understandable for both you and other developers. Here are some best practices for naming functions and variables in Python:\n","\n","1. Use Descriptive and Meaningful Names:\n","\n","Choose names that clearly convey the purpose or meaning of the function or variable.\n","Avoid generic names like x, temp, or data unless the context makes their meaning obvious.\n","2. Follow PEP 8 Naming Conventions:\n","\n","PEP 8 is the official style guide for Python, and it provides recommendations for naming conventions:\n","Use lowercase letters for variable names (e.g., my_variable).\n","Use lowercase with underscores for function names (e.g., calculate_total).\n","Use uppercase letters for constants (e.g., PI).\n","Use a single leading underscore for \"internal use\" variables (e.g., _private_variable).\n","Use double leading underscores for name mangling (e.g., __private_method).\n","Avoid using single uppercase letters as variable names, except for special cases (e.g., i for loop counters).\n","3. Be Consistent:\n","\n","Maintain consistency in your naming conventions throughout your codebase. If you choose a particular style for variable or function names, stick with it.\n","4. Use Verb-Noun Naming for Functions:\n","\n","Describe what the function does using a combination of verbs and nouns. For example, calculate_total or get_user_input.\n","5. Choose Clear and Concise Names:\n","\n","Keep names reasonably short but descriptive. Avoid overly long names that make code hard to read.\n","Balance between clarity and brevity. A name like calculate_total_cost_of_items_in_shopping_cart is clear but too long. calculate_total_cost may be more appropriate.\n","6. Avoid Reserved Keywords:\n","\n","Avoid using Python's reserved keywords (e.g., class, for, if, else) as variable or function names.\n","7. Use CamelCase for Class Names:\n","\n","Use CamelCase (capitalizing each word without spaces) for class names. For example, MyClass or HttpRequestHandler.\n","8. Use Snake Case for File Names:\n","\n","Use lowercase letters and underscores for file names (e.g., my_module.py)."],"metadata":{"id":"3h3hLlYZcnUR"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"zNQJ0wemc39d"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
